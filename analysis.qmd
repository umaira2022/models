Predicting voter preferences is a common task in political data science, often involving binary outcomes like yes/no responses. This analysis uses a March 2024 poll of 1,559 respondents to estimate the proportion of voters who would support Joe Biden in the upcoming presidential election.
However, our modelâ€™s accuracy depends on assumptions like stability and representativeness, which may be violated if voter preferences change over time or if the survey sample does not reflect the actual voting population.

$$P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}}$$
